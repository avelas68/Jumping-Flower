With the help of a partner, my partner and I were able to code in javascript using the P5.JS library. 
My partner designed a beautiful flower with a varitey petals.
I was able to code that whenever a user pressed a key the flower jumped and gained a new petal.
Each petal that the flower had was displayed on screen according the number of petals.
